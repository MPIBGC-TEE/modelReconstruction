	Abstract = {What is the distribution of the time required for particles to transit a compartmental system? What is the age distribution of particles in the system? These questions are important to understand the dynamics of modeled processes in many scientific fields. Until now, they could be answered only for systems in steady state, but the steady-state assumption is very restrictive and almost always unreasonable. Nonlinear relations between compartments and changing environmental factors keep systems permanently changing. A theory is presented here to describe the time evolution of age densities under changing environmental influences in nonlinear systems. An application is provided, addressing questions of high scientific and societal interest such as the lifetime of fossil fuel-derived atmospheric carbon.Many processes in nature are modeled using compartmental systems (reservoir/pool/box systems). Usually, they are expressed as a set of first-order differential equations describing the transfer of matter across a network of compartments. The concepts of age of matter in compartments and the time required for particles to transit the system are important diagnostics of these models with applications to a wide range of scientific questions. Until now, explicit formulas for transit-time and age distributions of nonlinear time-dependent compartmental systems were not available. We compute densities for these types of systems under the assumption of well-mixed compartments. Assuming that a solution of the nonlinear system is available at least numerically, we show how to construct a linear time-dependent system with the same solution trajectory. We demonstrate how to exploit this solution to compute transit-time and age distributions in dependence on given start values and initial age distributions. Furthermore, we derive equations for the time evolution of quantiles and moments of the age distributions. Our results generalize available density formulas for the linear time-independent case and mean-age formulas for the linear time-dependent case. As an example, we apply our formulas to a nonlinear and a linear version of a simple global carbon cycle model driven by a time-dependent input signal which represents fossil fuel additions. We derive time-dependent age distributions for all compartments and calculate the time it takes to remove fossil carbon in a business-as-usual scenario.},

@article{Sierra2015,
	Abstract = {We propose here a general mathematical framework to represent soil organic matter dynamics. This framework is expressed in the language of dynamical systems and generalizes previous modeling approaches. It is based on a set of six basic principles about the decomposition of soil organic matter: 1) mass balance, 2) substrate dependence of decomposition, 3) heterogeneity of the speed of decay, 4) internal transformations of organic matter, 5) environmental variability effects, and 6) substrate interactions. We show how the majority of models previously proposed are special cases of this general model. This approach provides tools to classify models according to the main principles or concepts they include. It also helps to identify a priori the general behavior of different models or groups of models. Another important characteristic of the proposed mathematical representation is the possibility to develop particular models at any level of detail. This characteristic is described as a modeling hierarchy, in which a general model of a high degree of abstraction can accommodate specific realizations of model structure for specific modeling objectives. This framework also allows us to study general properties of groups of models such as their qualitative behavior, time-scale of application, and their dynamic stability. For instance, we find conditions under which models are asymptotically stable, i.e. converge to a stable steady-state in the long-term, but may approach this state with or without oscillations. We also expand the concept of dynamic stability for models that include time-dependencies and do not converge to a fixed steady-state, but rather to a region of stability in the state-space. As an example of the application of the concept of dynamic stability, we show how this framework helps to explain the acclimation of soil respiration fluxes in soil warming experiments.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The response of soil carbon dynamics to climate and land-use change will affect both the future climate and the quality of ecosystems. Deep soil carbon (>20 cm) is the primary component of the soil carbon pool, but the dynamics of deep soil carbon remain poorly understood. Therefore, radiocarbon activity (C), which is a function of the age of carbon, may help to understand the rates of soil carbon biodegradation and stabilization. We analyzed the published C contents in 122 profiles of mineral soil that were well distributed in most of the large world biomes, except for the boreal zone. With a multivariate extension of a linear mixed-effects model whose inference was based on the parallel combination of two algorithms, the expectation--maximization (EM) and the Metropolis--Hasting algorithms, we expressed soil C profiles as a four-parameter function of depth. The four-parameter model produced insightful predictions of soil C as dependent on depth, soil type, climate, vegetation, land-use and date of sampling (). Further analysis with the model showed that the age of topsoil carbon was primarily affected by climate and cultivation. By contrast, the age of deep soil carbon was affected more by soil taxa than by climate and thus illustrated the strong dependence of soil carbon dynamics on other pedologic traits such as clay content and mineralogy.},

	Abstract = {Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle{\textendash}climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used 14C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil carbon by a factor of more than six (430 {\textpm} 50 years versus 3100 {\textpm} 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 {\textpm} 27\%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Soil carbon (C) is a critical component of Earth system models (ESMs), and its diverse representations are a major source of the large spread across models in the terrestrial C sink from the third to fifth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Improving soil C projections is of a high priority for Earth system modeling in the future IPCC and other assessments. To achieve this goal, we suggest that (1) model structures should reflect real-world processes, (2) parameters should be calibrated to match model outputs with observations, and (3) external forcing variables should accurately prescribe the environmental conditions that soils experience. First, most soil C cycle models simulate C input from litter production and C release through decomposition. The latter process has traditionally been represented by first-order decay functions, regulated primarily by temperature, moisture, litter quality, and soil texture. While this formulation well captures macroscopic soil organic C (SOC) dynamics, better understanding is needed of their underlying mechanisms as related to microbial processes, depth-dependent environmental controls, and other processes that strongly affect soil C dynamics. Second, incomplete use of observations in model parameterization is a major cause of bias in soil C projections from ESMs. Optimal parameter calibration with both pool- and flux-based data sets through data assimilation is among the highest priorities for near-term research to reduce biases among ESMs. Third, external variables are represented inconsistently among ESMs, leading to differences in modeled soil C dynamics. We recommend the implementation of traceability analyses to identify how external variables and model parameterizations influence SOC dynamics in different ESMs. Overall, projections of the terrestrial C sink can be substantially improved when reliable data sets are available to select the most representative model structure, constrain parameters, and prescribe forcing fields.},
