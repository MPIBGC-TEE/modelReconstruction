Models representing ecosystem carbon dynamics are generally complex and difficult to analyze. Comparing
different models with different structures is even more challenging due to the variety of processes represented
in the models. However, it is possible to use the numerical output of models to reconstruct the original structure
using a common mathematical framework. In this manuscript, we demonstrate this approach and apply it to compute
radiocarbon dynamics of a land carbon model. The proposed approach can reconstruct the carbon and radiocarbon
dynamics of the original model very accurately, and can be used to study system-level dynamics of complex contrasting models.
